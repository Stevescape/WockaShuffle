Better Spotify Shuffle

The shuffle in spotify is biased towards popular songs. This has the effect of shuffling a giant playlist resulting in you hearing
the same song a bunch of times. My program grabs 1 of your playlists, shuffles the songs and then adds it into a new playlist in the
newly shuffled order.
