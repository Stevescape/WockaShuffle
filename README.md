# This readme is for the WockaShuffle Project
# It gives a brief overview of WockaShuffle


My program is my own version of the Spotify Shuffle algorithm. It connects
to the Spotify Developer API so all of the authentication is done on their
end. With WockaShuffle, you select one of your playlists and then the program
creates a brand new playlist (will replace the existing WockaShuffle playlist if it exists)
and then adds the songs to the list in a shuffled order. The intended use of the
playlist is the play the playlist in the custom order without shuffle.

For running the .exe:
1) Extract the folder
2) Have the WockaShuffle folder inside of another folder (It will create a cache.txt file in the parent folder of WockaShuffle)
3) Run the WockaShuffle.exe file
4) Sign into the Spotify authentication (The program does not have any access to your credentials)
5) Enjoy!
